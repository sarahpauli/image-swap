<h1>Hawaii's Beautiful Islands</h1>

<p><em>By Sarah Pauli</em></p>

<p>Hawaii is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. In 2022, I had the privilege of visiting several of its islands, and I wanted to share with you my two favorites using some JavaScript knowledge. After working on this page, I have learned to change the CSS style of an element through the use of the Document Object Model. </p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I took ALL of the pictures included in this assignment on my trip to Hawaii in 2022.</p>

<p>You can find the link to my GitHub repository for this page here.</p>

    <p>Click on the image above to see a special celebration of Kamehameha Day, celebrating Hawaii's King Kamehameha. On this day only every year, locals drape leis over the statue to honor the King. I was lucky enough to catch this celebration in person during my last day on the island!</p>
