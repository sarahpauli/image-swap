<h1>Hawaii's Beautiful Islands</h1>

<p><em>By Sarah Pauli</em></p>

<p>Hawaii is one of the most beautiful places on Earth. In 2022, I had the privilege of visiting several of its islands, and I wanted to share with you my two favorites using some JavaScript knowledge. After working on this page, I have learned to change the appearance of an element through the use of the Document Object Model. </p>

<p><strong>DISCLAIMER:</strong> I took ALL of the pictures included in this assignment on my trip to Hawaii in 2022.</p>

    <p>Hover over the image above to see some of Kauai's beautiful trees! If you think they look familiar, these trees were featured in a few scenes from the first Jurassic Park movie.</p>

    <p>Click on the image above to see a special celebration of Kamehameha Day, honoring Hawaii's King Kamehameha. On this day only every year, locals drape leis over the statue in front of Ali'iolani Hale in respect of the King. I was lucky enough to catch this celebration in person during my last day on the island!</p>
